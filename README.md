# sem-3-process-sale

For Seminar 3 there are two tasks that should be completed: 

In task 1 a program shall be written that implements everything from the basic flow and for the startup scenario in seminar two. The code shall be compliable and executable and shall also follow all guidelines presented in chapter six of the course book. The solution must have high cohesion, low coupling and good encapsulation with a well-defined public interface. All public declarations must also have a comment.

In task 2, unit tests shall be written for the program that was built in task 1. There must be tests written for at least two classes. To score 2 points however ether must be unit tests for all classes in the layers controller, model and integration.
